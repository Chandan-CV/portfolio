## About
I am a senior in high school. I have been coding since 8th grade, I started with C++ and then started doing robotics with Arduino, had one of the best days staying up all night building robots and rovers. This went on till 9th. after 9th I also started learning core java seriously, built many projects like voting software for my school, A machine learning library, an android app, etc.
Then I spent a month building my first android app and deploying it to the play store (it's called Orator). Then I spent my entire 11 learning Cross-platform mobile and web development using react native and react js. I also did machine learning with python for a while.
Now I work as a lead software developer at Cledge.org and as a volunteer developer at MIT PathCheck.
